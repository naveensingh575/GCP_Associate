Short-lived cheaper (upto 80%) compute instances
Can be stopped by GCP any time (preempted) within 24 hours
Instances get 30 second warning (to save anything they want to save)
Use Preempt VM's if:
Your applications are fault tolerant
You are very cost sensitive
Your workload is NOT immediate
Example: Non immediate batch processing jobs
RESTRICTIONS:
NOT always available
NO SLA and CANNOT be migrated to regular VMs
NO Automatic Restarts
Free Tier credits not applicable
Spot VM : Similair to Preemptible VM but they don't have maximum runtime, all other things are same.
